## Installing MongoDB on macOS and Linux

 You can download the MongoDB Community Server from the [MongoDB download page](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community). The download is a zip file. Unzip the contents, change the folder name to “mongodb”, and move it to your users home directory. From there, create a “mongodb-data” directory in your user directory to store the database data.

You can start the server using the following command. Make sure to swap out `/Users/louis.liao/` with the correct path to your users home directory.

`/Users/louis.liao/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/louis.liao/mongodb-data`
